**About the Project:**

Bio-informatics is a research field which involves using computer science and computational tools for medical and biological purposes. Using computer science and specifically machine learning techniques for such research offers a significant power and allows conducting research in ways and scales that are not possible otherwise. Important area of research is the study of the DNA. Our research focuses on non-coding parts of the DNA, and specifically in its role of projecting autism appearance in children.
While the coding part has been a target of a lot of research over the last few years, nowadays it is understood that some of the answers to questions such as disease appearances can't be answered through additional research of this coding part, and deeper analysis of the non-coding part is needed. Our aim is to recreate and make accessible former research models of this topic, and use those models for further analysis.
We use machine learning and deep learning models and techniques to achieve this goal, and give the research lab the ability to continue it's research using those tools.
  
**How to use:**

First run the Install.py script, this script downloads all the original training data for the Deepsea model.  
To train the Deepsea model run train.py.  
To get TF-MoDisco results and visualization run tf_modsico.py.
